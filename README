PURPOSE     RandAlign reads a multiple sequence alignment, shuffles the content across:

              1. sites within each sequence [retains entropy of each sequence];
              2. sequences within each site [retains entropy of each site];
              3. sites as well as sequences.
              
            All sites or variant sites are considered.

            The resulting alignments are printed to two files.
 
FORMAT      Sequences must be stored in the FASTA format.
 
DATA TYPES  Nucleotides, di-nucleotides, codons, 10-state genotypes, 14-state genotypes 
            and amino acids.

COMPILE     g++ randalign.cpp -o randalign -O3 -Wall

HELP        Simply type randalign in the command line
